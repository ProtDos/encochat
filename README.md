## About
High Secured Terminal Chat App

This is a terminal-based chat app that uses advanced encryption and security protocols to ensure that all communications are kept private and secure. To guarantee this, we encrypt every activity you do:
* creating a room
* setting a password
* sending a message
* leaving a room
* joining a room
* creating a private key

## Features

* Millitary encryption used for chat messages
* 1995-bit key exchange for secure communication between users in a group
* Automatic secure deletion of all messages after a person left the group
* Not a single piece in information is send to us: Account information (username/password/creation/activity), messages, groups, contacts and more. All your information is safe
* End-To-End encryption

## Installation and Setup
